# MSFS IoT Bridge

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)

A DIY-friendly bridge between Microsoft Flight Simulator (MSFS 2020 / 2024)
and autonomous IoT hardware.  Polls live flight state via SimConnect and
broadcasts it as typed UDP JSON packets on the local network — no broker, no
firewall holes, no cloud dependency.  Any WiFi-capable device on the same LAN
can listen and react independently: ESP32s, Raspberry Pi Zeros, Pico Ws,
Arduinos, or anything else with a radio.

## What you can build

- **Haptic feedback seats** — feel engine starts, landings, and G-forces through a bass shaker
- **Home cockpit panels** — drive physical switches, lights, and gauges from real sim state
- **Motion platforms** — feed attitude and G-load to seat actuators or motion rigs
- **Custom annunciators** — light up stall warnings, gear unsafe, and autopilot modes on real hardware
- **Moving-map displays** — drive a Pi Zero or tablet with live lat/lon/altitude
- **Environmental effects** — trigger fans, rumble motors, or LEDs based on speed, weather, or impacts

No PC-side changes needed for new devices — just bind the UDP port and start receiving.

## The distributed peripherals model

The design is intentionally asymmetric: one broadcaster, many listeners, each
listener completely independent of every other.

Rather than building a single complex controller that handles everything —
gear lights, flap indicators, haptic feedback, airspeed displays — the
approach is to scatter the cheapest WiFi-capable microcontrollers you can
find and give each one exactly one job.  An ESP32 costs under $5.  A
Raspberry Pi Pico W costs $6.  Each runs a handful of lines of MicroPython,
watches the one or two packet types it cares about, and discards the rest in
a single string comparison.

A few consequences of this architecture that matter in practice:

**No central hub, no single point of failure.**  Each device boots, joins the
network, and starts receiving independently.  If the haptic seat reboots
mid-flight, it comes back on its own.  No other device notices.

**Adding a device costs nothing on the broadcaster side.**  The PC sends one
packet per group per interval regardless of how many microcontrollers are
listening.  Plugging in a tenth ESP32 has no measurable effect on CPU or
network load.

**Fault isolation is structural, not designed.**  A gear-light panel that
crashes doesn't affect the airspeed indicator.  A firmware bug in a new
flap-position servo doesn't interrupt haptic feedback.  The broadcast is the
only shared surface; everything downstream is air-gapped by design.

**The unit economics are brutal in your favour.**  Basic haptic peripheral:
~$3 ESP32 + $2 vibration motor + $2 MOSFET = $7 total.  Three-light gear
indicator: ~$3 ESP32 + $1 in LEDs = $4.  A full simpit peripheral ring costs
less than a single commercial USB device with worse latency.

This is the Unix philosophy applied to a flight deck: each process does one
thing, does it well, and talks over a shared pipe.

## Overview

Any device on the same LAN — an ESP32, a Raspberry Pi, a tablet, another PC —
can listen on a single UDP port and react to flight events in real time,
without any inbound firewall exceptions on the simulator PC, without a
subscription handshake, and without combining multiple packets to derive a
single value. On modern gigabit networks the overhead is minimal, and cheap
microcontrollers can easily listen for specific packet types without undue
processing overhead.

Packets are organised into **ten semantic groups**, each transmitted at a rate
matched to how fast that data actually changes.  Every packet is a
self-contained JSON object small enough to fit in a single Ethernet datagram
(under 1 472 bytes), so there is no IP fragmentation and no reassembly work on
the receiver side.

### Packet groups at a glance

| Type | Rate | Size | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DYNAMICS` | 20 Hz | ~413 B | Attitude, G-load, body acceleration, stall / overspeed |
| `GEAR` | 10 Hz | ~403 B | Gear position, wheel RPM, brakes, ground contact |
| `SURFACES` | 10 Hz | ~502 B | Flaps, spoilers, control-surface deflection and trim |
| `ENGINES` | 10 Hz | ~873 B | Per-engine RPM, N1/N2, EGT, throttle, fuel flow |
| `POSITION` | 5 Hz | ~337 B | Lat/lon/alt, airspeeds, magnetic variation |
| `AUTOPILOT` | 5 Hz | ~506 B | AP mode flags and reference values |
| `ELECTRICAL` | 2 Hz | ~249 B | Bus voltages, current draw, switch states |
| `ENVIRONMENT` | 1 Hz | ~381 B | Wind, temperature, pressure, precipitation |
| `LIGHTS` | 1 Hz | ~145 B | Light switch states |
| `STATIC` | 0.1 Hz | ~531 B | Aircraft identity and design parameters |

Total broadcast bandwidth across all groups: **≈ 251 Kbps** (0.25 Mbps).

## Quick start

### 1 — Create a virtual environment and install dependencies

Open a terminal in the project folder and run:

```bat
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> On first activation you will see `(venv)` prepended to your prompt.
> Run `venv\Scripts\activate` again in any new terminal you open.

### 2 — Start Microsoft Flight Simulator

Launch MSFS 2020 or 2024 and load any flight — the main menu is enough, but
data only begins flowing once a flight (or mission) is active and a world is
loaded.  SimConnect connects to the running sim process; the broadcaster will
retry automatically if the sim is not ready yet.

### 3 — Run the broadcaster

With the venv active and the sim running:

```bat
python sim_broadcaster.py
```

You should see output like:

```
SimConnect connected.
Broadcasting on 255.255.255.255:49000
```

The script keeps running until you press **Ctrl+C**.  UDP packets start
flowing immediately — no handshake, no pairing required.

### 4 — Verify packets with Wireshark

[Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) lets you inspect the raw packets on
the wire without writing any receiver code.

1. **Open Wireshark** and select your active network adapter (usually
   labelled "Wi-Fi" or "Ethernet").
2. **Enter this display filter** in the filter bar and press Enter:

   ```
   udp.port == 49000
   ```

3. Packets will appear immediately.  Click any row to expand it; the JSON
   payload is visible in the "Data" section of the packet detail pane.

   If you changed the default port with `--port`, substitute that number in
   the filter (e.g. `udp.port == 49001`).

**Tip:** Use `Edit → Find Packet` (Ctrl+F) and search in "Packet bytes" for
`"DYNAMICS"` or `"GEAR"` to jump straight to a specific packet type.

---

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 or 2024
- Python 3.10 or later
- [`SimConnect`](https://pypi.org/project/SimConnect/) Python library

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The simulator must be **running** before `sim_broadcaster.py` is started.
SimConnect connects to the sim process directly; there is no network address
to configure on the sim side.

---

## Usage

```
python sim_broadcaster.py
```

Optional arguments:

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--ip` | `255.255.255.255` | Destination IP.  `255.255.255.255` broadcasts to every device on the local subnet.  Pass a specific IP (e.g. `192.168.1.42`) to unicast to one device. |
| `--port` | `49000` | UDP destination port. |

```
python sim_broadcaster.py --port 49001
python sim_broadcaster.py --ip 192.168.1.255          # directed subnet broadcast
python sim_broadcaster.py --ip 192.168.1.42 --port 5000  # unicast to one device
```

Press **Ctrl+C** to stop cleanly.  SimConnect is disconnected and the socket
is closed before the process exits.

---

## Configuration

Open `sim_broadcaster.py` and edit the constants near the top of the file.

### Update rates

These are the default values — they are calibrated to the rate at which each
data group actually changes in practice, and are reasonable for most use cases.
Adjust them only if you have a specific reason (e.g. a slower IoT device that
can't keep up, or a motion platform that needs higher fidelity).

```python
INTERVALS: dict[str, float] = {
    "DYNAMICS":    1 / 20,   # 20 Hz — attitude, G-load, body acceleration
    "GEAR":        1 / 10,   # 10 Hz — gear position, wheel RPM, brakes
    "SURFACES":    1 / 10,   # 10 Hz — flaps, spoilers, control surface deflection
    "ENGINES":     1 / 10,   # 10 Hz — RPM, N1/N2, EGT, throttle, fuel flow
    "POSITION":    1 /  5,   #  5 Hz — lat/lon/alt, airspeeds
    "AUTOPILOT":   1 /  5,   #  5 Hz — AP modes and reference values
    "ELECTRICAL":  1 /  2,   #  2 Hz — bus voltages, battery load
    "ENVIRONMENT": 1.0,       #  1 Hz — wind, temperature, ambient pressure
    "LIGHTS":      1.0,       #  1 Hz — light switch states
    "STATIC":     10.0,       # 0.1 Hz — aircraft identity and config (rarely changes)
}
```

The main loop runs at the fastest configured rate (`DYNAMICS`).  All slower
groups are gated by elapsed time.  Raising `DYNAMICS` to 50 Hz is safe on a
modern machine but will not make gear/surface events perceptibly faster because
SimConnect itself caps its output at roughly 18 Hz for most variables.

### SimConnect cache

```python
SIM_CACHE_MS = 50
```

The SimConnect Python library caches each variable for this many milliseconds
before re-querying the simulator.  50 ms is appropriate for a 20 Hz loop.
Reducing it below 20 ms has no practical benefit and increases CPU overhead.

### Engine count

```python
NUM_ENGINES = 4
```

The `ENGINES` packet always contains four engine slots.  Receivers should
read `num_engines` to know how many slots are valid; the rest will be zero.
Engines are 1-indexed in the field names (`combustion_1`, `n1_pct_2`, etc.).

---

## Network architecture

### Why UDP broadcast?

- **No inbound connections** — the simulator PC never accepts a socket
  connection from an IoT device, so no firewall rule is needed.
- **Zero configuration** — a new receiver joins by binding the port; the
  broadcaster needs no knowledge of it.
- **Decoupled scaling** — additional receivers are free; the broadcaster
  sends exactly one packet per group per interval regardless of listener count.

### Packet loss

UDP provides no delivery guarantee.  On a switched gigabit LAN, loss is
effectively zero under normal conditions.  For haptics and motion platforms
this is fine: a dropped packet is simply a skipped frame.  Receivers that
need to detect gaps can use receive-time: a gap larger than
`2 × expected_interval` between consecutive packets of the same type means
one was dropped.

### Subnet broadcast vs directed broadcast

`255.255.255.255` is the limited broadcast address.  Routers do not forward
it, so it reaches only devices on the directly connected subnet.  If your
network is segmented, use the subnet's directed broadcast address instead
(e.g. `192.168.1.255` for a `/24` network).

---

## Architecture notes

### Why the engine indexed-variable workaround?

The SimConnect Python library maintains a single `Request` object per indexed
variable template (e.g. `GENERAL ENG RPM:index`).  Calling
`aq.get("GENERAL_ENG_RPM:1")` and then `aq.get("GENERAL_ENG_RPM:2")` on the
same `AircraftRequests` instance mutates the same underlying object via
`setIndex()`, which rewrites the SimConnect data definition and triggers a
re-registration (`redefine()`).  You cannot hold two different indices live at
the same time through this API.

`sim_broadcaster.py` works around this by constructing one `Request` object
per `(variable, engine)` pair with the index baked into the SimConnect
variable name at construction time (e.g. `b"GENERAL ENG RPM:2"`).  These
objects bypass the `AircraftRequests` cache and register directly with the
SimConnect DLL.  They are completely independent and can be polled
simultaneously.

### Adding a new variable to an existing group

1. Find the SimConnect variable name in the
   [MSFS SDK documentation](https://docs.flightsimulator.com/html/Programming_Tools/SimVars/Simulation_Variables.htm)
   or in `venv/Lib/site-packages/SimConnect/RequestList.py`.
2. Add a line to the relevant `build_*` function using `_f()`, `_i()`, or
   `_s()`.
3. Verify the packet still fits under 1 472 bytes by running:
   ```
   python - <<'EOF'
   import json
   # paste a sample packet dict here and check len(json.dumps(it))
   EOF
   ```

### Adding a new packet group

1. Add an entry to `INTERVALS` with the desired rate.
2. Write a `build_mygroup(aq)` function returning a dict with a `"type"` field.
3. Add the lambda to the `builders` dict inside `run()`.

## Troubleshooting

**`SimConnect` import fails**
> `pip install SimConnect` — the package must be installed in the same Python
> environment you are using to run the script.

**`Exception: SimConnect: connection failed`**
> The simulator is not running, or SimConnect is disabled.  Start MSFS / P3D
> before running the broadcaster.  For P3D, ensure SimConnect is enabled in
> the add-on XML configuration.

**No packets received on the IoT device**
> 1. Confirm both machines are on the same subnet and that no managed switch
>    is filtering broadcast traffic.
> 2. Try a directed broadcast to the subnet address (e.g. `--ip 192.168.1.255`)
>    instead of `255.255.255.255`.
> 3. Check that the Windows Defender firewall is not blocking **outbound** UDP
>    on port 49000 from `python.exe` (outbound rules are usually open by
>    default, but corporate images sometimes restrict them).

**Packets arrive but values are all zero**
> SimConnect returns `None` for variables it cannot provide (e.g. turbine N1
> on a piston aircraft, or gear position on an aircraft without retractable
> gear).  The `_f()` / `_i()` helpers convert `None` to `0.0` / `0`.  This
> is expected — use the `STATIC` packet's `engine_type` and
> `is_gear_retractable` fields to contextualise zero values.

**High CPU usage**
> Lower the `DYNAMICS` rate or raise `SIM_CACHE_MS`.  The broadcaster polls
> SimConnect on every loop iteration; reducing the loop rate directly reduces
> CPU overhead.

**`ENGINES` packet is missing fields for engines 3 and 4**
> Only `num_engines` engines are active; slots for inactive engines contain
> zeros.  This is normal.

## Tools

The `tools/` directory contains standalone diagnostic scripts for use alongside
`sim_broadcaster` during development and debugging.

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `tools/capture_gear.py` | Listen on UDP and print incoming `GEAR` packets — no SimConnect needed |
| `tools/engine_diag.py` | Connect to SimConnect directly and log engine start/stop transitions in real time |

See [`tools/README.md`](tools/README.md) for usage details.

---

## Modules

The `modules/` directory contains self-contained IoT receiver implementations
that consume the UDP broadcast from `sim_broadcaster` and drive physical
hardware.  Each module lives in its own subdirectory alongside any supporting
files, firmware notes, and wiring diagrams.

| Path | Target | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `modules/haptic/esp32/` | ESP32 + bass shaker | Haptic feedback for engine events and landings |

---

## Haptic Feedback Module — `modules/haptic/esp32/generator.py`

### What it is

`modules/haptic/esp32/generator.py` is a MicroPython script that runs directly
on an ESP32 microcontroller.  It connects to the local Wi-Fi network, listens
for `ENGINES`, `GEAR`, and `DYNAMICS` UDP packets from `sim_broadcaster`, and
drives a bass shaker (motion actuator) via PWM to produce physical haptic
feedback that matches flight events in real time — engine starts, engine stops,
and landings of varying severity.

No PC-side software changes are required; the script is a pure UDP consumer.
It runs autonomously on the ESP32 from power-on (as `main.py`) and needs no
host connection once deployed.

### Packets consumed

| Packet | Fields used | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `ENGINES` | `starter_1`, `combustion_1` | Detect engine start / stop transitions |
| `GEAR` | `on_ground` | Detect touchdown |
| `DYNAMICS` | `g_force`, `vertical_speed_fpm` | Scale landing impact intensity |

### Setup

#### 1 — Wi-Fi credentials

Create `secrets.py` alongside `generator.py` on the ESP32:

```python
SSID     = "YourNetworkName"
PASSWORD = "YourPassword"
```

`generator.py` imports `SSID` and `PASSWORD` from this file at boot.

#### 2 — Deploy to ESP32

Upload both files to the ESP32 as `main.py` and `secrets.py`.  MicroPython
automatically executes `main.py` on every boot, so the haptic receiver starts
without any manual intervention.

#### 3 — Wire the hardware

```
ESP32 microcontroller
    ↓ GPIO14 (PWM output)
    ↓
MOSFET gate (signal input)
    ↓ drain
    ↓
Bass shaker / motion actuator
    ↓
Ground (common with ESP32, MOSFET, and external PSU)
```

The PWM signal on GPIO 14 switches the MOSFET, which controls current from an
external power supply through the bass shaker.  The ESP32 itself does not
supply drive current to the shaker.

### Haptic events

**Engine Startup** (`engine_start`)
- **Trigger**: Starter engages on a cold engine (`starter` transitions 0→1 while `combustion` is 0)
- **Sequence**: Starter motor crank (uneven rumble) → ignition catch thuds → RPM climb → idle settle
- **Duration**: ~2.3 seconds
- **Feel**: Realistic multi-stage startup sequence from cold crank to smooth idle

**Engine Shutdown** (`engine_stop`)
- **Trigger**: Engine transitions from running to off (`combustion` goes 1→0)
- **Sequence**: Abrupt power loss thud → RPM wind-down → final prop spin fade
- **Duration**: ~1.1 seconds
- **Feel**: Power loss impact followed by descending pitch and intensity

**Landing Impact** (`landing_haptic`)
- **Trigger**: Aircraft touches down (`on_ground` transitions 0→1), or high-impact contact
  detected during the initial ground baseline (G > 1.2 or descent > 150 fpm)
- **Cooldown**: 5 seconds between triggers to suppress bounce re-fires
- **Intensity scaling**: The higher of two independent estimates drives output:
  - G-load above 1 G: 1.0 G → 0.0 intensity, 2.5 G → 1.0
  - Sink rate: 50 fpm → 0.0 intensity, 800 fpm → 1.0
- **Intensity tiers**:
  - Soft (< 0.2): single soft thud + gentle wheel-roll rumble
  - Firm (0.2–0.55): double thuds + moderate runway vibration
  - Hard (> 0.55): triple thuds + sustained heavy vibration
- **Duration**: 0.5–1.5 seconds depending on landing severity

### Tuning

All haptic parameters — PWM frequency, duty cycle, segment durations, and
intensity curves — are plain constants and function arguments in `generator.py`.
No recompilation is needed; edit the file and re-upload.

Key functions:

| Function | Role |
|---|---|
| `engine_start()` | Full startup sequence: crank, ignition catches, RPM build, idle settle |
| `engine_stop()` | Shutdown sequence: power-cut thud, RPM decay, prop fade |
| `landing_haptic(peak_g, touchdown_vs_fpm)` | Intensity-scaled touchdown: thuds + runway roll-out |
| `ramp(f0, f1, d0, d1, ms)` | Linearly sweep frequency and duty over time |
| `roll(freq, duty, duration_ms)` | Sustained rumble with per-step random variation |
| `thud(freq, duty, hold_ms, tail_ms)` | Single hard-attack impact with fast decay |

## Community — build something and share it

The `modules/` directory is designed to grow.  The haptic seat is one starting
point; the ten broadcast channels carry enough data to drive dozens of
independent devices simultaneously.
